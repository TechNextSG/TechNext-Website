"""Nexi Explains: the animated series starring Nexi, listed season by season on /nexi-explains.

One entry per post. `yt` is the YouTube video id once the video is uploaded (scheduled premieres count:
the page counts down to `premiere` and switches the card to "Watch" by itself when that time passes).
Posts without an id show as "Coming soon". To publish a new episode: add its `yt` and `premiere`
(UTC, from YouTube Studio), then run `python _src/build.py`.

Thumbnails live in assets/img/nexi-explains/<thumb>.webp (640x360, from the delivered YouTube
thumbnails). A post without a `thumb` gets a drawn card instead: `pose` picks the Nexi render shown on it.

Numbers and titles follow the posting plans in the Marketing drive:
00. TechNext Folder/22. Nexi Solution Videos/00 Posting Plan.md (Season 1 + Quick Tips 01-14),
26. Nexi Explains - Season 2/00 Season 2 Posting Plan.md, 27. Nexi Holiday Specials.
